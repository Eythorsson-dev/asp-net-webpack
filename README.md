# asp-net-webpack
This is a demo application to test out webpack.

The projects goal is to be able to use the .vue extension when writing components and not having to use cmd (use npm runner after build) to rebuild the files
# Todo
  - Missing Vue Loader
  - Missing npm run script 
  - Missing fontawsome and bootstrap-icons from npm instead of local import
